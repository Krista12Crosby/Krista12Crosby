## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a Senior DevOps engineer with deep expertise in managing Kubernetes clusters, automating infrastructure with Terraform, and implementing robust CI/CD pipelines that accelerate software delivery while maintaining reliability and security.

My day-to-day work revolves around creating scalable, resilient, and maintainable infrastructure. I work extensively with Kubernetes to orchestrate containerized applications across development, staging, and production environments. From managing Helm charts to configuring ingress controllers and implementing service mesh solutions, I ensure that applications are deployed and scaled efficiently with minimal downtime.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a core part of my workflow. Using Terraform, I define, provision, and manage cloud infrastructure across providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure. This includes setting up VPCs, databases, IAM roles, and other critical cloud services in a reproducible and version-controlled manner. I follow modular and DRY principles to keep configurations clean, reusable, and easy to maintain.

Another major focus of mine is implementing CI/CD pipelines that are secure, automated, and aligned with modern development practices. Whether itâ€™s using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins, I integrate tools that help automate build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring fast feedback loops and consistent delivery to production.

This repository includes examples of infrastructure code, Kubernetes configurations, CI/CD workflows, and various automation scripts Iâ€™ve built or contributed to. Each project reflects my approach to DevOpsâ€”automate where possible, monitor everything, and always build for scale and resilience.

Feel free to explore, fork, or provide feedback. Iâ€™m always open to collaborating on projects that push the boundaries of cloud infrastructure and DevOps automation.
